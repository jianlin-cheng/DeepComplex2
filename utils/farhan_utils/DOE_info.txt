HOMO_STD dataset:

We selected homodimeric pairs based on the criterion that if the sequence identity between the interacting protein pairs is >=95%, we classify them as homodimers, else we say they are heterodimers.
The homodimer protein pairs whose sequence identity is 100% we term them as perfect homodimers, the rest are called homodimers 95
Inorder to homogenize the homodimeric pdb chains so they have the same sequence, the homodimer 95 sequences and individual chain files were reindexed to remove mismatching residue information.

HOMO30 dataset:

Comments: These lists again are a subset that we selected since creating all the features were not possible within this short time. Out of 10978 only 2948 were generated
	  For labels, we selected the homodimeric pairs with the highest number of contacts.

Everything is in lewis: /storage/htc/bdm/farhan/strind_db/

Known protein-protein interactions: binding_file.txt
We need the first two columns of this file only which is: binding_file_2_cols.txt
This was then sorted: sorted_binding_file.txt

All the monomer fasta sequences: protein.info.sequences.v11.0.fa
The monomer fasta dictionary: string_sequence_fasta_dictionary.txt
All the concatenated dimer sequences from the binding_file.txt [NOTE THIS FILE IS BIG]: /storage/htc/bdm/farhan/string_db/combined_strings_db/filter_combo/all_sequences.txt
This file has symmetric concatenation: fastaA+fastaB and fastaB+fastaA both
