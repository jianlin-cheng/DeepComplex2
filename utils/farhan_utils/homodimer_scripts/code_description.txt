cleanUpPDB.py: This script uses the multicom toolbox to clean up the pdbs. It creates the .atom, .seq, .dssp, etc files. It also does post cleanup cleanups
Usage: python cleanUpPDB.py <option.txt>

createFastaDB.py: this script reads the .seq files and creates a fasta list. [HARD PATHS]
Usage: python createFastaDB.py

createFastaDictionary.py: this script reads the .seq files and creates a fasta dictionary called "fasta_dictionary.txt"
Usage: python createFastaDictionary.py <.seq folder> 

createFastaFilesFromFastaDictionary.py: this script reads a fasta_dictionary.txt files to generate the individual fasta files and outputs them into a folder
Usage: python createFastaFilesFromFastaDictionary.py <fasta_dictionary.txt> <outputfolder>

createFastaDictionaryFromFolder.py: this script reads the folder of fastafiles and creates a fasta dictionary
Usage: python createFastaDictionaryFromFolder.py <fasta_folder> <output_file>

createFastaLength.py: this script reads the fasta_dictionary.txt file and creates a database/dictionary of PDB_Name and lengths [HARD PATHS]
Usage: python createFastaLength.py

dist2rr.py: this script reads a distance.txt file and converts to sorted contact map file in .rr format using hypothetical probability p=(1/d)+0.5
Usage: python dist2rr.py <input_dist_file> <outputfile>

getPrecision_inter_twocmaps.py: this script will calculate the precision by comparing two rr files. according to the requirement like Top-5, Top-10, etc.
Usage: python getPrecision_inter_twocmaps.py <rr_file_inter_true> <rr_file_predicted>

getPrecision_intra.py: this script will calculate the intrachain precision by comparing two rr files. according to the requirement like Top-5, Top-10, etc.
Usage: python getPrecision_intra.py <true.rr> <predicted.rr>

loadFastaDictionary.py: this script loads the fasta_dictionary.txt file into a dictionary. 
Usage: from loadFastaDictionary import loadFastaDictionary

makePDBListAllFiles.py: this script creates a file list from a directory of .atom or .pdb or .seq, etc files

makePDBList.py: this script creates a pdb "name" list from a directory of .atom or .pdb or .seq, etc files

makeSymmetry.py: this script will read the contact map .rr file and convert it to a symmetric matrix
Usage: python makeSymmetry.py <input_file> <output_file>


pdb2distance_inter_heavy.py: this script creates a interchain distance map and a contact map text file using heavy atoms [HARD PATHS for atom_folder and fasta_dictionary]
Usage: python pdb2distance_inter_heavy.py <atom_file_A> <atom_file_B> <distance_threshold> <outfile>

readPDBColumns.py: PDB reading and processing library
readPDBColumns_v2.py: PDB reading and processing library

readPDB.py: PDB reading and processing library
readRR.py: Contact map reading and processing library

reindex.py: this script will reindex the residue numbers in the pdb/atom file according to a mapping function
Usage: python reindex.py <input_atomfile> <reindex_mapping_dictionary> <output>

removeAlternatesFromPDB.py: this script filter outs alternate B residues from pdbs like BCYS and keeps the ACYS as CYS
Usage: python removeAlternatesFromPDB.py <in_pdb> <output_pdb>

sequenceAlign.py: this script aligns two fasta sequences and outputs the final alignment.
Usage: python sequenceAlign.py <id_pdb1> <fasta1> <id_pdb2> <fasta2>

sortrr.py: sorts an contact mapn rr file and prints its contents
Usage: python sortrr.py <contact_map_file.rr> <reverse=True (high prob to low) or False>
